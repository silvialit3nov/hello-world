# hello-world
College student studying supply chain management. I like to read and write. I love Jesus! I'm bilingual (English and Spanish) and multi-ehthnic. 

Throughout my years from elementary to high school, I played a variety of sports. These include tennis and football (real football) as well as dancing.
